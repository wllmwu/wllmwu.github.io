## Introduction

I'm a fourth-year computer science student at UC San Diego. I chose to study CS in order to learn more about how modern technology works, in both theory and practice, and how I could build things for others to use and enjoy. My fields of interest include software/game development, security, UX and accessibility, and ethics in AI. I'm also a vice president of Triton Software Engineering, a volunteer student org at UCSD where we develop software for local nonprofits, and I recently founded a startup working to make farmers' markets more accessible.

In my free time, besides writing code for different projects, I enjoy playing Minecraft, editing videos, reading the Discworld series and science/tech/gaming news, and making models and renders in Blender.

## About this site

I am building this website with Next.js, a React framework, and hosting it through GitHub Pages. I design and implement the components myself.

Typefaces:

- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) and [Barlow Semi Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed) (headings)
- [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) (body text)
- [Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono) (code)

I used [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to generate the favicon files and code.
