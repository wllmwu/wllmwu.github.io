## Description

**Review 100+ math formulas, write notes, calculate solutions, and add your
own!**

Math Keeper is a handy reference app for anyone who would like a refreshment of
their memory about high school math, or perhaps anyone who would like a
refreshment of their memory about what they were supposed to have learned in
class yesterday. If you identify with either, you have come to the right place.

The app includes over 100 math formulas for a quick jog of the memory, and you
are able to edit them, write notes, and add your own if you so desire. A
calculator is also built in for convenience, just one swipe away.
