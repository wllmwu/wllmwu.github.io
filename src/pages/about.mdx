# About

## Introduction

I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Computer Science. I chose
to study CS in order to learn more about how modern technology works, in both
theory and practice, and how I could build things for others to use and enjoy.
My fields of interest include software/<wbr /> game development, security, UX
and accessibility, and ethics in AI.

In my free time, besides writing code for different projects, I enjoy playing
_Minecraft_ and other games, editing videos, reading the _Discworld_ series and
science/<wbr />tech/<wbr />gaming news, and making 3D animations in Blender.

## About this site

I build this website with TypeScript + Vite + React and host it through GitHub
Pages. I design and implement the components myself.

Typefaces:

- [Barlow Semi Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed)
  (headings)
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) (body text)
- [Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono) (code)

I used [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to generate the
favicon files and code.
