Hi! I'm a computer science graduate and software developer. I enjoy learning and
making things. Here are some pages on this site that I'd like to feature:

<Showcase
  items={[
    siteShowcases.about,
    projectShowcases.wrongCave,
    projectShowcases.courseGrapher,
    appShowcases.copyBetter,
    projectShowcases.tse,
  ]}
