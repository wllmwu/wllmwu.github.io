## About TSE

<aside>
  <p>Visit our website at [tse.ucsd.edu](https://tse.ucsd.edu)!</p>
</aside>

**Triton Software Engineering** is a student organization at UC San Diego where
we develop software pro bono for local nonprofits. Our members are developers,
designers, engineering managers, product managers, and executive
officers&mdash;all student volunteers committed to our mission of using
technology for social good.

TSE has grown a lot since its founding in 2017. We had over 90 members each year
that I was in the org, and we've partnered with more than 30 different clients
as of my final undergraduate year.

I was accepted into TSE in my first year at UCSD and was a developer for two
years, during which I worked on four unique projects for the org. I then served
as VP Engineering for another two years&mdash;my responsibilities were to lead
our engineering managers, ensure all projects were progressing smoothly, and
help resolve conflicts and technical issues. I gained invaluable experience,
skills, and connections from TSE, and I'm glad that the things we make are
helping communities in San Diego, across the country, and even around the world.

## Projects

These are the projects that I worked on as a developer at TSE. You can also
check out our entire GitHub portfolio at

### Onboarding Guide (2023)

During my second year as VP Engineering, I designed a guide/<wbr />tutorial for
newly recruited TSE developers to introduce them to web development with the
MERN stack. The guide takes students through our complete software engineering
process, from analyzing a design prototype (shown in the above screenshots) to
implementing React components and Express routes to testing and debugging. We
originally wrote the guide's starter code to use Create React App, but due to
the tool's deprecation, I later migrated it to Vite instead. My experience with
Vite led me to use it for my personal website too.

### Distribution Web App (2020&ndash;21)

</ImageCarousel>

A web application designed for [Feeding San Diego](https://feedingsandiego.org),
a local food charity organization, to track information about food distribution
schedules and the agencies they partnered with. It greatly streamlines the
process of viewing and editing the data they had stored.

This project was my first at TSE, and I learned a lot about JavaScript, React,
and the rest of the typical MERN stack while working on it. I also began to
understand how software engineers come together to solve problems, which I
suspect will be a lifelong learning experience.

### Green Home App (2021)

</ImageCarousel>

A mobile app designed for Your Clear Way, a nonprofit focused on helping people
adopt more sustainable practices, to "gamify" the process of making one's home
and lifestyle more environmentally friendly. Users earn badges for completing
various tasks.

This project was already near completion when I was assigned to help finish it
up. It actually took a lot longer than expected due to some strange deployment
issues, broken dependencies, and client miscommunication, but as an organization
we drew valuable lessons from it which will guide our approach to future
projects and clients.

### Moneta (2021&ndash;22)

</ImageCarousel>

An online database application that nonprofits can register with for free and
customize for their own needs. While most of our projects are tailor-made for
individual clients, Moneta (named after the Roman goddess of memory) is more
like software as a service hosted and maintained by TSE.

By the time I began working on this project, I had learned even more about React
and general software engineering principles, and I was able to apply much of
that knowledge. I also discovered that I enjoy code review (unpopular opinion?)
because it's a good opportunity to reinforce my understanding of said
principles, in collaboration with a team, and to maintain high standards.

### Goods Transport App (2022)

A mobile app designed for
[Laktaa](https://laktaa.medium.com/getting-started-ba193caa1f39), a nonprofit
dedicated to providing logistical support to farmers and other rural citizens in
Bhutan. The app connects farmers to truck drivers who can deliver their goods to
markets, ports, and other destinations.
