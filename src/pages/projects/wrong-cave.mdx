## Introduction

In Spring 2024, I took the course **[CSE 125](https://cse125.ucsd.edu) (Software
System Design and Implementation)** with Professor Geoff Voelker. This course
centers on a single quarter-long team project: the creation of a **distributed
real-time 3D multiplayer game** in just 10 weeks, culminating in a
[live demonstration](https://youtube.com/live/LMllEYOQoI8) for an audience of
department faculty, course alumni, other students, and the public.

</figure>

As CSE 125 is offered only once a year and space is limited to about 30
students, the application process prioritizes demonstrated commitment and
problem-solving ability. (See the
[course overview](https://cse125.ucsd.edu/2024/overview.html) for more details.)
Thus, I'm honored to have been a part of the course and I consider it to be one
of my most significant experiences at UC San Diego.

Students in the course were separated into five groups. Each group had six
developers and one artist who worked together on their own unique game from
concept to implementation. As shown on the
[2024 groups page](https://cse125.ucsd.edu/2024/groups.html), every game ended
up turning into something distinctive and interesting:

- Asymmetric party crafting game (my team's!)
- Rhythm-based Soulslike boss fight
- Asymmetric maze dungeon crawler
- Exploration/<wbr />collection/<wbr />stealth game
- Character ability-based capture-the-flag/<wbr />domination shooter

The groups page contains links to each group's website and live demo recording.
From the thumbnails alone, it's clear that the only limit was our imagination!

## Our game

</figure>

_Wrong Cave!_ is a two-stage asymmetric couch co-op crafting game in which a
team of heroes tries to escape a cave and fight off the Mushroom King who lives
there. In the first stage, the heroes frantically craft weapons and armor using
resources collected from around the cave, while a small mushroom minion
(controlled by another player) sneaks around and sabotages their efforts.

      alt="Two hero players gathering resources far away"
    />
  </div>
</figure>

In the second stage, the king breaks free (controlled by whoever played the
minion) and tries to destroy the heroes or the minecart they need to escape; the
heroes must protect themselves and the minecart using the weapons they have
acquired.

      height={240}
      alt={
        'Mushroom king standing in front of a minecart labelled "Heroes\' escape"'
      }
    />
  </div>
</figure>

The game runs in web browsers, much like the many .io browser games in recent
years, so there is no need to install anything else to play it. A live instance
was supposed to run on the [CSE 125 server](http://cse125.ucsd.edu:2345), but it
currently seems to be shut down.

We aimed to make the hero experience feel _frantic_ and _chaotic_&mdash;hero
players must keep track of several different crafting recipes, throw and chase
items around the cave, and try to avoid the minion's traps. On the other hand,
the boss experience is one of being _sneaky,_ _powerful,_ and _in control._

Some of our chief inspirations for the game concept and major design elements
included:

- [_Overcooked_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overcooked) for its gameplay
  mechanics and chaotic feel (hence our working title of _Undercooked_). Our
  game could perhaps be summarized as "_Overcooked_ with a boss fight."
- [_Among Us_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us) for its asymmetric roles
  and sabotage mechanics. Though it wasn't a specific inspiration, our game's
  aesthetic also features goofy, cartoonish visuals.
- Games in the [Soulslike genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulslike) for
  their large, powerful bosses and highly difficult combat. This became less
  important as our ideas evolved and we focused more on the crafting aspect of
  the game (as well as its goofiness), but its influence is still present in the
  design of our boss character.
- Web games like [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io) for their simple
  interface/<wbr />HUD style and lobby system.

## Tools and technologies

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org):** Primary source code
  language.
  - Our choice of making a web game meant JavaScript and TypeScript were our
    best options. For large projects like this one, the static type checking
    that TypeScript provides is crucial for catching mistakes.
  - Most groups over the years have used the classic combination of C++ and
    OpenGL. I believe one group so far has used Rust.
- **[cannon-es](https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/docs/index.html):** Physics
  engine.
  - Using this library gave us rigid body motion basically for free, but it came
    with many caveats that required workarounds. For example, the engine only
    checks for collisions at an object's current location each tick, not along
    the line segment from its previous to its current location.
  - I think that ultimately, we still saved time by using the library instead of
    rolling our own physics, but I think it would have been a cool experience to
    write a custom physics engine too.
- **[WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API):**
  For rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
  - Our earliest decision as a team was to use WebGL so that our game could be
    played in browsers on any platform, and having this chance to learn about
    WebGL was the main reason I joined this group. Fortunately, I and several
    others already had experience with OpenGL, which is very similar to
    WebGL&mdash;the latter just has a few more limitations.
  - We found the [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org) website
    to be pretty helpful. It has tutorials that walk through a large number of
    topics with plenty of examples.
- **[glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net):** Vector and matrix math utility library.
  - Another downside of using cannon-es was that it came with its own
    implementations of vectors, matrices, and quaternions which were not
    type-compatible with glMatrix. Since glMatrix offered many operations
    (particularly ones relevant to graphics) that cannon-es didn't, we often had
    to convert between the two types which led to some inconsistencies.
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com)** and
  **[ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws):** Network communication via the
  [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
  - In general, large multiplayer games often use custom protocols based on UDP
    connections to reduce bandwidth usage. Because we use a set of locally
    connected machines with high bandwidth and low latency for the final demo in
    this course, students can just use TCP connections and less
    compressed/<wbr />optimized data structures for transmitting game states.
  - For our group in particular, since we were making a web game, UDP wasn't an
    option to begin with (browsers only allow TCP). We also got a lot of
    functionality basically for free from JS/TS&mdash;for example, JSON data
    marshalling is built into the language.
- Other APIs:
  **[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)**
  for sounds, **HTML/CSS** for user interface.
  - As with some other parts of the stack, we got these for free because all
    modern browsers provide them.
- Development tools: **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com)** for package management,
  **[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)** for bundling (very fast),
  **[ESLint](https://eslint.org)** for code linting,
  **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)** for code formatting, and of course
  **[Git](https://git-scm.com)** for version control.
  - The linting was pretty minimal because some members of the team didn't like
    using a linter. I basically learned JS/TS with the recommended ruleset so
    don't find it obtrusive, but we ended up turning off most rules to save time
    for others who weren't accustomed.
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org):** 3D modeling and texturing.
  - We exported our models as **[glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)** files to
    make them easy to process&mdash;this format is designed to work well with
    WebGL and OpenGL.

## Our journey

For a more in-depth chronicle of our game development journey, please see our
project specification, weekly reports, and final review on
[our group page](https://cse125.ucsd.edu/2024/cse125g1/). I'll summarize our
weekly progress here:

- **Week 1:** We held a long meeting to nail down some game design elements.

  - The core gameplay loop remained basically the same for the rest of the
    quarter: three players craft weapons on a timer while a fourth player
    sabotages them, then the fourth becomes a boss and they battle each other.
  - We knew from the beginning that we wanted to use WebGL so the game could be
    played in browsers, even if this meant sacrificing some performance.
  - We left several elements (aesthetics, story, certain mechanics such as
    exactly how crafting would work, etc.) intentionally undecided, to return to
    them later; we needed to investigate things like JavaScript physics
    libraries and the performance implications of dynamic lighting first.

- **Week 2:** Concept art; basic physics simulation on the server; camera set up
  and rendering physics objects and static textured meshes on the client.

  </figure>

- **Week 3:** More concept art; discussion of server code
  architecture/<wbr />logic organization; exploration of various lighting and
  shading models (point lights with shadows, cel shading).

  <figure>
    <Image
      source="/images/wrong-cave/dev/cylinder.png"

      server.

  </figure>

- **Week 4:** Processing player inputs and translating to movement; shader
  pipeline to allow postprocessing steps; first-person camera and freecam mode;
  placeholder models; basic particle system; team social.

  - This was the first key milestone of the project: a client that sends inputs
    to a server, which responds with an updated game state that the client
    renders.

- **Week 5:** Collision detection through the physics engine; 2D outline and cel
  shaders; the first of many object models.

- **Week 6:** Picking up items; parsing triangle mesh collider from object file
  (used for generating the map's collision mesh).

  </figure>

- **Week 7:** Support for multiple players; throwing items; recipe crafting
  system; revamped player movement system; revamped map collider parsing (using
  boxes instead of a triangle mesh because the latter didn't work very well);
  boss minion character; _lots_ of new models.

  - Our team morale was the lowest around this point in the quarter. It seemed
    like every week, we discovered more new tasks than we completed old ones,
    and the game was still more of a sandbox engine than a game where each
    player has a goal and a way to win or lose.
  - I think we didn't know enough about the tools and game elements yet to
    properly plan out our requirements early on, so having this experience seems
    helpful for avoiding that kind of situation in the future.

- **Week 8:** Sound effects; crafting stations and resource spawners; boss
  sabotage mechanics (blinding and setting traps); lighting fixes; revamped
  particle system; first playtests with most of the team.

  - Half of the team got sick during this week, sadly. But we pulled through!
  - As every game developer knows, playtests were hugely helpful for identifying
    high-priority issues that intruded on the player experience. We continued
    playtesting and tuning often in the run-up to the demo.

  </figure>

- **Week 9:** Game stages and win conditions; combat system; in-game text
  rendering; user interface; final game map; even more models; simple animation
  system; more sound effects.

  - At this point, there was a way to _win,_ so we finally had a true game.
  - The game itself had also become a _platform_&mdash;all our work on physics,
    graphics, networking, controls, game objects, etc. created foundational
    infrastructure on which we could quickly build and iterate new features and
    interactions.
  - For example, we thought that a combat system would take multiple weeks to
    build, so we were planning to first implement a simpler (from the players'
    perspective) version which was essentially a clicking contest between heroes
    and boss. However, we really wanted to push for real in-game combat, and it
    actually turned out to be relatively easy to achieve thanks to the
    aforementioned platform. That is, instead of needing to build it from the
    ground up, we could just add on to existing systems like item interaction.

  </figure>

- **Week 10:** Big boss character; full two-stage game sequence; polished UI,
  lobby, and lighting; ability to correctly restart the game; in-game crafting
  recipe guides; particles, camera shake, and other "juicy" effects; many small
  features, fixes, optimizations, and quality-of-life changes; final demo!

  - As tends to happen in these situations, the majority of this work occurred
    in the 24 hours before the demo
    ([nearly 200 of our ~700 commits!](https://github.com/ucsd-cse125-sp24/group1/commits/main/?since=2024-06-06&until=2024-06-07)).
    We didn't even procrastinate, having made pretty steady progress all
    quarter, but there was just that much left to do.
  - The final demo went smoothly and we got to show off most of the interesting
    mechanics we created, as well as some of our debugging features. And of
    course, one or two known bugs that remained. It was a great finale to a
    great quarter.

## Takeaways

- **The importance of task tracking:** We mainly tracked our work informally by
  discussing what we had done/<wbr />were going to do at our weekly meetings. I
  think we all wanted to focus on getting things done with minimal overhead,
  especially with no official "person in charge." But on several occasions, we
  accidentally did duplicate work or forgot about an important task. Some other
  groups used GitHub Issues and I also use them a lot personally, so such a
  system could have helped us save some time.
  - Incidentally, we also didn't use Git branches much. Early on this made sense
    because we were working on low-level building blocks of the project that
    couldn't easily be separated. Later, though, it possibly might have helped
    make things cleaner.
- **The importance of being present:** I made an effort to show up to every
  meeting in-person that I could. But I don't mean to call out anyone who missed
  a couple meetings; this point is more about the effort part, and I think all
  of my team members similarly tried their best to make ourselves a cohesive
  unit. That meant being responsive to messages, contributing ideas, asking
  questions, and listening to feedback, because we all were passionate about the
  project and had the same goal. And the best parts of the quarter to me were
  the times when we were together as a team, whether hammering out some new code
  at a meeting or getting food at the local mall.
- **The importance of making well-reasoned product decisions:** From the start
  of the project, our discussions often revolved around the experience we wanted
  to create for players and ways to achieve that experience. (_The Art of Game
  Design_ by Jesse Schell describes this kind of approach.) We generated many,
  many different ideas over the course of 10 weeks, but we always made sure to
  examine them through that lens (and some others, such as "is it feasible to
  implement?" or "will it impact performance?"). I think this approach helped
  make our game feel more cohesive, as everything in it was made intentionally
  with a higher purpose in mind.
- **The importance of cleaning up after yourself:** WebGL and OpenGL have a lot
  of different types of buffers and bindings. One common and hard-to-debug issue
  that we encountered was forgetting to unbind/<wbr />clean up everything at the
  end of a function or block. If something is left behind and is still there
  during the next WebGL operation, it's likely to create some kind of invalid
  state and you get a nonspecific warning or error.
