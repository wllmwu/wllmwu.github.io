> Google Drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-mQgpf7eo10vAjqenEMp3s3ccZ2DYv_D](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-mQgpf7eo10vAjqenEMp3s3ccZ2DYv_D)

This folder contains slideshows and example programs that I made while teaching a Python class. Feel free to read through, try out the programs, and educate yourself. More resources and guides are coming soon!
